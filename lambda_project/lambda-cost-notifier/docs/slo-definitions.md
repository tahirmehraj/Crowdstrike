# Service Level Objectives - AWS Cost Notifier

## Overview

This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the AWS Cost Notifier system, establishing measurable reliability and performance targets for automated daily cost reporting.

## SLO Definitions

### 1. Availability SLO

**Objective**: 99.5% successful daily cost notification delivery

- **Measurement**: Ratio of successful to expected executions
- **Time Window**: Rolling 30-day period
- **Calculation**: `(Successful executions / Total expected executions) × 100`
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Lambda function executes without errors
  - Cost data retrieved successfully
  - Email delivered via SES
  - Tracking record created in DynamoDB
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarm on Lambda Errors metric
- **Acceptable Downtime**: ~3.6 hours per month (1.5 failed days)

### 2. Performance SLO

**Objective**: 95% of executions complete within 30 seconds

- **Measurement**: Lambda execution duration from start to completion
- **Time Window**: Rolling 7-day period  
- **Calculation**: `(Executions ≤30s / Total executions) × 100`
- **Measurement Method**: CloudWatch Lambda Duration metric (Maximum statistic)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarm triggers at 30-second threshold
- **Safety Buffer**: 60-second Lambda timeout provides 2x performance margin

### 3. Reliability SLO

**Objective**: Daily execution occurs within 25-hour window of scheduled time

- **Measurement**: Time variance from expected 8 AM UTC execution
- **Time Window**: Per execution cycle
- **Tolerance**: ±1 hour from scheduled time (7 AM - 9 AM UTC acceptable)
- **Grace Period**: 25-hour detection window accounts for:
  - Daylight saving time changes
  - EventBridge scheduling variations  
  - CloudWatch metric propagation delays
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarm on Lambda Invocations metric
- **Escalation**: Missing execution alarm after 25 hours

### 4. Data Freshness SLO

**Objective**: Cost reports reflect T-1 (previous day) spending data

- **Measurement**: Report date alignment with AWS Cost Explorer data availability
- **Constraint**: AWS Cost Explorer inherent T-1 data limitation
- **Success Criteria**: Reports sent on day T contain costs for day T-1
- **Validation**: Lambda function logs verify date consistency
- **Monitoring**: Application-level validation in cost data retrieval

## Error Budget

### Monthly Error Budget Calculation

**Base Calculation** (99.5% availability):
- Expected monthly executions: ~30
- Allowable monthly failures: 0.15 executions
- **Practical Error Budget**: 1 failure every 2 months

### Error Budget Consumption

**Budget-consuming events**:
- Lambda function execution failures
- Cost Explorer API failures (after retry exhaustion)
- SES email delivery failures  
- Missing daily executions
- DynamoDB tracking failures (when preventing execution)

**Non-budget events**:
- Successful retries within execution window
- Performance SLO violations (warnings only)
- Tracking failures that don't prevent email delivery

## SLO Monitoring Implementation

### Primary Metrics

**Built-in Lambda Metrics**:
- `AWS/Lambda/Invocations` - Execution count
- `AWS/Lambda/Errors` - Failure count  
- `AWS/Lambda/Duration` - Performance measurement

**Custom Application Metrics**:
- Structured logging for business logic success/failure
- Cost Explorer API response times
- Email delivery confirmation tracking

### Alert Configuration

**Immediate Alerts** (Critical):
- Any Lambda execution error (100% error budget consumption)
- Missing execution after 25 hours (reliability breach)

**Warning Alerts**:
- Duration >30 seconds (performance SLO at risk)
- Cost Explorer API slowness trends

**Dashboard Visualization**:
- SLO compliance trends over time
- Error budget burn rate
- Performance percentile distributions

## SLO Review and Adjustment

### Review Schedule

**Monthly**: 
- SLO compliance assessment
- Error budget utilization review
- Performance trend analysis

**Quarterly**:
- SLO target reassessment based on business needs
- Alert threshold optimization
- Historical performance pattern analysis

### Adjustment Criteria

**Tightening SLOs** (consider if consistently exceeding targets):
- >99.8% availability for 3+ months
- >98% executions under 20 seconds

**Relaxing SLOs** (consider if consistently missing targets):
- Frequent error budget exhaustion
- Underlying AWS service reliability changes
- Business priority shifts

## Business Impact Context

### SLO Rationale

**99.5% Availability**: 
- Balances reliability with cost optimization
- Acknowledges non-critical nature of cost reporting
- Allows for occasional AWS service disruptions

**30-Second Performance**:
- Ensures reasonable user experience expectations
- Accounts for Cost Explorer API variability
- Provides buffer for retry logic execution

**25-Hour Reliability Window**:
- Accommodates global time zone considerations
- Handles daylight saving time transitions
- Prevents false alarms from minor scheduling drift

### Cost vs. Reliability Trade-offs

**Current Architecture** optimized for:
- Cost efficiency over maximum availability
- Operational simplicity over complex redundancy
- Reasonable reliability for non-critical business function

**Alternative Approaches** (not implemented):
- Multi-region deployment for higher availability
- Sub-minute performance targets requiring more resources
- Real-time alerting requiring additional infrastructure complexity

These SLOs reflect the appropriate balance between system reliability and operational cost for an automated daily cost reporting system.
