# AWS Cost Notifier
## Automated Daily Cost Reporting Solution

---

## Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Manual AWS cost monitoring is inefficient and error-prone

- Teams lack visibility into daily spending patterns
- Cost surprises at month-end impact budget planning
- Manual cost checks consume valuable engineering time
- No automated alerts for cost anomalies

**Business Impact**: Reactive cost management instead of proactive optimization

---
