# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for Demo API
# ======================================
# This HPA automatically scales the demo API based on CPU and memory utilization
# Demonstrates auto-scaling for handling variable load patterns

  # Scaling metrics
  metrics:
  # CPU-based scaling (primary metric)
  - type: Resource
    resource:

      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70    # Scale up when average CPU > 70%

  # Memory-based scaling (secondary metric)
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60    # Scale up when average memory > 60% (safer threshold)

        value: 2                        # Or add max 2 pods at once
        periodSeconds: 60
      selectPolicy: Max                 # Use the more aggressive of the two policies

    scaleDown:
      # Scale down conservatively to avoid thrashing

      policies:
